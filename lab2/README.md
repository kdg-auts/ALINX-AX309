# lab2 - Working with a sound emitter (buzzer)

**Main goal:** Learn how to work with active and passive sound emitters (buzzer or beeper). Learn how to form different variants of sound signals. Learn how to reuse previously created modules.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement a module for generating various types of sound signals: short-term single, long-term single, double short-term
1. Integrate previously developed modules for buttons and LEDs into a project with a sound emitter. Make the necessary changes to the imported modules to integrate them with sound signal emitter
1. Implement a module that will output a sound signal when switching the LED indication modes: 
    1. a short-term single signal when circulating between the modes "permanently off", "permanently on" and "slow flashing" (with period of 1 sec)
    1. double short-term signal when switching to the "fast flashing" mode and long beep when exiting this mode.

**Involved resources:**
* 4 buttons
* 4 LEDs
* piezoelectric sound emitter
