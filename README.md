# FPGA Laboratory workshop with ALINX-AX309 development board

A set of simple projects to familiarize yourself with the resources of the ALINX AX309 development board.
The core element of the board is an FPGA chip of the Xilinx Spartan 6 family, model XC6SLX9.
A detailed description of the board resources, the FPGA chip used, and how to configure the FPGA chip can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/kdg-auts/ALINX-AX309/wiki).

List of projects included:
* **lab0** - Introductory project (buttons and LEDs, get familiar with board and IDE)
* **lab1** - Advanced processing of simple I/O resources (buttons debouncing and LED indication modes)
* **lab2** - Sound generation
* **lab3** - Using of 7-segment Hex-number LED display (simple FSM to control displayed numbers)
* **lab4** - Simple Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART module)
* **lab5** - Storing data in non-volatile memory (external EEPROM IC, I2C interface module)
* **lab6** - Video signal output interface (VGA)

The details of each project are described in the respective folders.
