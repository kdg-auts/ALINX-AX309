# lab0 - Introductory project

**Main goal:** Get acquainted with the design environment (Xilinx ISE Design Suite) and the Spartan 6 FPGA family. Master the typical process of designing a digital system using the implementation of a substitution block for the DSTU GOST 28147:2009 encryption algorithm as an example. To learn how to describe simple combinational devices in VHDL.

**Tasks:**
1. Theoretical development of a solution, preparation of a description in the VHDL language.
1. Creation and support of the project, settings and parameters management.
1. Enter descriptions and manage project source code.
1. Perform simulation and functional verification of the developed solutions.
1. Setting up and execution of all technological processes of synthesis. Setting design constraints.
1. Preparation and execution of the FPGA configuration process on the development board. Creation of a permanent configuration (recording the configuration to the service non-volatile FLASH memory).

**Involved resources:**
* 4 buttons
* 4 LEDs
